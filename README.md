# getnextline
A simplified version of readline()

# get_next_line Project

## Objective
The get_next_line project focuses on creating a function that reads a line from a file descriptor, using file manipulation and dynamic memory allocation.

## Key Features
- **Line Reading:** Development of a function to read a line from a file descriptor.
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation:** Efficient allocation and deallocation of memory.
- **Buffer Management:** Effective handling of different buffer size to read and store data incrementally.
- **Error Management:** Robust error handling for file reading and memory allocation failures.

## Skills Developed
- **File Manipulation in C**
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**
- **Buffer Management Techniques**
- **Error Handling**

## Challenges
- Efficiently managing memory for varying line lengths and buffer size.
- Using static variables efficiently.
- Handling edge cases and potential errors during file reading.

## Achievements
- Successful implementation of a versatile line reading function.
- Proficiency in dynamic memory allocation for flexible data storage.

## Outcome
The get_next_line project equips students with practical skills in file manipulation and memory allocation.
